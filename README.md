# FlxSpotlightShader
A spotlight shader in flixel

Creates a few spotlights that have a black outline, no Venn-diagram-style outline intersections, apply a blendmode within, and do not alter black pixels.

See SpotlightShader.hx for the meat and potatoes, with the last lil blendmode bit of the file being the stew mix.

Example:
